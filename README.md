# Personal Portfolio
This project involves building a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS. The goal of this website is to showcase my skills and work experience to potential employers or clients.

Website Layout: The website will consist of several sections, including:

Home: A brief introduction about myself and my skills, including a profile picture.

About Me: A more detailed description of myself, my background, and my interests.

Projects: A showcase of my previous work, including screenshots and descriptions of each project.

Skills: A list of my technical skills, including programming languages, software, and tools.

Contact: A form that allows visitors to contact me directly, along with links to my social media profiles.

Design: The website design will be clean, professional, and easy to navigate. I will use a responsive design to ensure that the website looks good on all devices.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, and possibly some JavaScript for added functionality.

Challenges: The main challenges in building this project will be designing a visually appealing layout, ensuring that the website is accessible to all users, and making sure that the website loads quickly.

Expected Outcome: By the end of this project, I will have a professional-looking personal portfolio website that showcases my skills and work experience. This website will help me to stand out to potential employers or clients and provide them with an easy way to contact me.
